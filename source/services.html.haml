        %p  
          Sometimes you need to display information in a dashboard format to keep a team on the same page or to give customers a quick/easy way to view the value you're providing to them. We can consume data from a variety of data sources and present them in a visually compelling way that quickly presents important information.

        %strong Custom CMS
      %p
        WordPress is the reigning king of website content management systems. We highly recommend it for websites, blogs and simple web apps build from a series of off the shelf plugins. But, there comes a point where the amount of custom work becomes onerous to maintain in WordPress. When you reach this point, it can make sense to build a custom CMS using a framework more suitable for custom application development, like Rails.

      %p
        We do a lot of work on back office and process improvment tooling, bringing manual business processes online. Many of these ideas start out as shared spreadsheets or some kind of manual email task workflow. Bringing them online improves access to shared resources, creates a unified environment for establishing and refining an official business processes, and helps speed up communication and efficiency through automation.
